# APY-Interest-Payment-Calculator
A Java program that converts APY to APR. The program then calculates daily/weekly/monthly interest earnings based on how frequently the interest is compounded as well as the amount of balance accuring interest. This program is proven to show accurate results for services such as Celsius, a crypto interest platform which compounds weekly.
